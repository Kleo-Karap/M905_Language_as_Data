M.Sc. in Language Technology M905- Quantitative Analysis of Language Data

## Descriptive Statistics
1. Choose one of the texts available in 75texts.zip and create N  (where N>30) files with an equal (if possible) number of words (using Python). 
2. Calculate the TTR, h-point, R1, Entropy, L and Average Token Length for each 
(using QUITA) and save the results in a csv file. 
3. Create charts to view the values by index. 
4. Find the dominant value for the h-point indicator. 
5. Examine if there are outliers for the above indicators. 
6. After removing the outliers, calculate the mean, median and standard deviation for each indicator. 
7. Generate the histogram and the corresponding probability density function for the values of each indicator. 
8. Comment on the distribution of values for each indicator (e.g., similarity to the normal distribution, skewness/asymmetry).
   
## Inferenctial Statistics

1. Use the results of the first task (i.e. the QUITA results) to estimate a confidence interval for the average value of the following indicators: TTR, Entropy, and Average Token Length.
2. a. Confirm the results of query (1) for by applying the appropriate tests.

   b. Present 2 illustrative diagrams graphically representing a result rejection and a non-rejection result of the NULL Hypothesis.
4. Collaborate with another group that has chosen a different text in 1. Task so that their results are available to you from QUITA. Check if the mean values of the TTR, Entropy, and Average Token Length indicators are different (statistically) significantly. Assume that the samples are independent. (Consider sample 1 to be your own your results and as sample 2 the results of the other group).
